# GitHub for Beginners

GitHub consist the two main things . 

1) Version Control 
2) Git

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Now first of all what is Version Control.

**Let's see what is Version Control**:-

* Version control helps developers track and manage changes to a software project’s code. As a software project grows, version control becomes essential.

* It is not good to directly edit the main file similar as our rough work you want to just try to solve a question but you will not directly attempt it on the main notebook , you first try it on rough note book then if you were able to get the desired solution you write it in the Main Notebook.

* Similar to the above analogy Branches are their in the version control if you want to add some funtion to the main program you first make a diffrent branch edit what ever you want now if it is working properly then you can merge it in the main branch.

* All the previous edits ans the files which you are edited are stored in the version control.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




# Now second Question is What is Git?

# Let's see what is Git:-

* Git is a specific open-source version control system created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.

* Specifically, Git is a distributed version control system, which means that the entire codebase and history is available on every developer’s computer, which allows for easy branching and merging.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



**Now final question Whats is Github then?**


* GitHub is a for-profit company that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service. 

* Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.

* GitHub’s interface is user-friendly enough so even novice coders can take advantage of Git. Without GitHub, using Git generally requires a bit more technical savvy and use of the command line.

* There are many things to learn in the git but here we will be focusing on the the syntax of the basic git commands. All the commanda here given are run on the terminal

//If any one has updated the repository on the git hub and you are also working on it then you can update the file stored in your local macine my Syntax------> **git pull origin branchname**

* For pushing the code for 1st time in that branch Syntax------> **git push --set -upstream origin branchname**

* From 2nd time for pushing we can use---------->**Syntax------> git push**    

* For unstaging the file Syntax------> **git restore --staged // git restore filename Syntax------> git rm –chached**
